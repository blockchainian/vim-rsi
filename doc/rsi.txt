INTRODUCTION                                    *rsi*

This plugin provides disfigured (not fully Emacs) mappings for insert and
command line mode that does not care about overlapping with built-in Vim
functionality.

MAPS                                            *rsi-maps*

                                                *rsi-CTRL-A*
<C-a>                   Go to beginning of line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-B*
<C-b>                   Go backwards one character.  On a blank line, kill it
                        and go back to the previous line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-D*
<C-d>                   Delete forwards one word.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-E*
<C-e>                   Go to end of line.  Falls back to |i_CTRL-E| if
                        already at the end of the line.  (|c_CTRL-E| already
                        goes to end of line, so it is not mapped.)

                                                *rsi-CTRL-F*
<C-f>                   Move forward one character.  Falls back to
                        |i_CTRL-F| or |c_CTRL-F| at the end of the line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-H*
<C-h>                   Moves backward one word.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-L*
<C-l>                   Moves forward one word.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-W*
<C-w>                   Delete backward one word.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-X*
<C-x>                   Delete to end of line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-U*
<C-u>                   Delete to head of line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-Y*
<C-y>                   Past from clipboard.
